just some late night thoughts now that patch connections are working with just shift registers

rpi synth might be something like:
32 outputs = 4 shiftouts
32 inputs = 4 shiftins
32 knobs = 4 muxes + ADC
16 buttons = another 2 shiftins
32 leds = another 4 shiftouts

totally reasonable circuit, could even double everything

future version, modular, module contains:
8 outputs (shiftout)
8 inputs (shiftin)
8 ana/button (mux)
8 led (shiftout)
some sort of module id
can shift registers be chained when physically that far apart?
basically non-modular (but patchable) design is way easier for now
